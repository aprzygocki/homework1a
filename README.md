# homework1a
This is my first attempt at using github to do homework for the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp.
I hear that creating a README file is important in all work done in development.
It lets other people understand what I am up to. 
I hope to master the github repository, master pull and push commands,
become intimately fimiliar with my machine, and refine my own capabilities as a full stack web developer.
Thanks for Reading!
